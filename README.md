# Library_Management_System_SQL

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Library Management System  
**Level**: Intermediate  
**Database**: `library_mang`

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.

## Objectives

1. **Set up the Library Management System Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

## Project Structure

```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_mang;

CREATE TABLE branch
(
            branch_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            manager_id VARCHAR(10),
            branch_address VARCHAR(30),
            contact_no VARCHAR(15)

            issued_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            issued_member_id VARCHAR(30),
            issued_book_name VARCHAR(80),
            issued_date DATE,
            issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(50),
            issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10),
            FOREIGN KEY (issued_member_id) REFERENCES members(member_id),
            FOREIGN KEY (issued_emp_id) REFERENCES employees(emp_id),
            FOREIGN KEY (issued_book_isbn) REFERENCES books(isbn) 
);



-- Create table "ReturnStatus"
CREATE TABLE return_status
(
            return_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            issued_id VARCHAR(30),
            return_book_name VARCHAR(80),
            return_date DATE,
            return_book_isbn VARCHAR(50),
            FOREIGN KEY (return_book_isbn) REFERENCES books(isbn)
);

```

### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
UPDATE members
SET member_address = '125 Oak St'
WHERE member_id = 'C103';
```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_id = 'IS104';
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
```sql
SELECT issued_book_name FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101';
```


**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT i.issued_member_id, m.member_name
FROM issued_status i
INNER JOIN members m
ON i.issued_member_id = m.member_id
GROUP BY issued_member_id
HAVING count(issued_book_name)>1;
```

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE VIEW book_cnt
AS
SELECT issued_book_name, count(issued_id) as book_issued_cnt
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY issued_book_name
ORDER BY book_issued_cnt DESC;
```


### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

Task 7. **Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

8. **Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT category, sum(rental_price) as Total_Rental_income,count(*)
FROM books
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY Total_Rental_Income DESC;
```

9. **List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**:
``'sql
SELECT member_id, member_name, member_address, reg_date
FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 180 DAY
ORDER BY reg_date DESC;
```

10. **List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details**:

```sql
SELECT e1.*, e2.emp_name as manager,b.manager_id,  b.branch_id
FROM employee e1
LEFT JOIN branch b
ON b.branch_id = e1. branch_id
JOIN employee e2
ON b.manager_id = e2. emp_id;
```

Task 11. **Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW Rental_price_Above_7
AS
SELECT book_title, rental_price
FROM books
WHERE rental_price > 7;
```

Task 12: **Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status as ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL;


WIth book_return AS (
	SELECT i.issued_id, i.issued_book_name, r.return_id
	FROM issued_status i
	LEFT JOIN return_status r
	ON i.issued_id = r.issued_id
)
select issued_book_name
FROM book_return
WHERE return_id IS NULL;
```

## Reports

- **Database Schema**: Detailed table structures and relationships.
- **Data Analysis**: Insights into book categories, employee salaries, member registration trends, and issued books.
- **Summary Reports**: Aggregated data on high-demand books and employee performance.

## Conclusion
